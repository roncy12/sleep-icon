        <li>Icon Sleep's 10-Year Limited Warranty applies to all mattresses purchased as new from our website icon-sleep.com</li>

    </ul>
        <p>Icon Sleep's standard 10-year Limited Warranty covers defects in workmanship and materials. This warranty becomes valid right after your purchase. Except for the specific limitations mentioned herein this warranty policy, your mattress will be subject to replacement or you will be entitled to a prorated refund, at our option, should we find your mattress defective because of faulty workmanship or structural defects. The warranty will be voided if, upon our thorough investigation, any of the following cases are proven true:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>An improper base is used by the customer that caused the mattress to fail</li>
        <li>The product is found to have been tampered with or misused by the customer beyond reasonable wear</li>
        <li>The product has been physically damaged intentionally or due to accident and/or neglect (incl. burns, cuts, water damage, mold, stains, or abnormally soiled or unsanitary)</li>
