                    <p>Like many others I bought a Sears Serta mattress and ran into the biggest nightmare. I am stage 3 CKD... I thought I needed a new mattress to be comfortable in my end time. I looked at many mattresses, there was so much oversell and over pricing I became very skeptical. So I decided to go with brands I knew I could trust. BIG BIG mistake. Paid Sears the price of a used car for an EXTRA FIRM Mattress, only to be told by both Seas and Serta that my EXTRA FIRM mattress was suppose to sink in the middle. Their return policies (both Sears and Sealy) are crafted to cover the defects in the mattresses. Why pay a restocking fee for a defective mattress, that you have been forced to sleep on for 30 days.</p>

                <p>The WORST mattress I have slept on. I would give a Zero Star if I could for both The Brick and Serta. Within months, the sides were sagging and my husband could no longer sleep comfortably. We contacted The Brick (Coquitlam) where we bought it and they sent out a warranty person who said it had sagged 'just' under the warranty requirements. That's with zero weight on it. No one was helpful. The Brick has washed their hands of this, and Serta wouldn't fulfill warranty. So now, we have a garbage bed, that is very uncomfortable- tossing and turning/sleepless nights. Never will I buy a Serta product again. I do not recommend this product at all to anyone who wants comfort or a good sleep.</p>

                <p style="line-height: 2;">3 days after purchasing the Tempurpedic "Grand" bed, I experienced pain where my right arm connects at the shoulder. After some research, it turns out other people have this exact problem. If you are experiencing pain,flip the mattress over so the thick foam is on top and add a 2-3" gel topper. Please note: The Grand Bed originally MSRP for $10,000 and I had to add a $160 topper to make it bearable. I think sleeping on 10,000 one dollar bills would've been more comfortable.</p>

                    <p>Like many others I bought a Sears Serta mattress and ran into the biggest nightmare. I am stage 3 CKD... I thought I needed a new mattress to be comfortable in my end time. I looked at many mattresses, there was so much oversell and over pricing I became very skeptical. So I decided to go with brands I knew I could trust. BIG BIG mistake. Paid Sears the price of a used car for an EXTRA FIRM Mattress, only to be told by both Seas and Serta that my EXTRA FIRM mattress was suppose to sink in the middle. Their return policies (both Sears and Sealy) are crafted to cover the defects in the mattresses. Why pay a restocking fee for a defective mattress, that you have been forced to sleep on for 30 days.</p>

                <p>The WORST mattress I have slept on. I would give a Zero Star if I could for both The Brick and Serta. Within months, the sides were sagging and my husband could no longer sleep comfortably. We contacted The Brick (Coquitlam) where we bought it and they sent out a warranty person who said it had sagged 'just' under the warranty requirements. That's with zero weight on it. No one was helpful. The Brick has washed their hands of this, and Serta wouldn't fulfill warranty. So now, we have a garbage bed, that is very uncomfortable- tossing and turning/sleepless nights. Never will I buy a Serta product again. I do not recommend this product at all to anyone who wants comfort or a good sleep.</p>
